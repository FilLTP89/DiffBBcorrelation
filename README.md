# Interfrequency-conditioned diffusion model for earthquake signal super-resolution

The project is forked from [STEAD_diffusion project](https://github.com/HugoGabrielidis16/STEAD_Diffusion.git) which develops a [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model [1]](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/4c5bcfec8584af0d967f1ab10179ca4b-Abstract.html) to generate broadband (0-30 Hz) earthquake accelerograms based on low-frequency signals obtained by numerical simulations of earthquake scenarios. 

This project conditions the generation of broadband signals by penalizing the inter-frequency correlation with an empirical model obtained from [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1785/0120170081).
